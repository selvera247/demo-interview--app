# Decisions

## 2026-10-03 — Use SQLite instead of DuckDB

- **Decision:** Keep SQLite as the demo datastore; do not add DuckDB.
- **Why:** The working scaffold already uses SQLite; migrating adds a dependency and rewrite cost without changing the hiring-manager demo narrative. SPEC amended accordingly (~40 accounts, SQLite).
- **Implications:** README, generator, MCP tools, and tests target SQLite. No `duckdb` in `requirements.txt`.

## 2026-10-03 — Slice 1 clean baseline data model

- **Decision:** Regenerate `finance.db` as a clean Northwind Digital baseline (entities `ND-US` / `ND-EU`, ~40 accounts, 24 months) with AR + AP/accrual/opex subledgers that reconcile to the TB. Remove prior planted anomalies from the generator; defer anomaly planting to slice 2.
- **Why:** SPEC requires a realistic CoA and reconciling subledgers under generic `source_system` labels. Prior data mixed legacy entities, real vendor system names, and generator-planted anomalies that made eval scoring circular.
- **Implications:**
  - Customer formerly named like the company was renamed to **Cedar Analytics**.
  - `source_system` values are only `ERP`, `Billing`, `HRIS`, `Expense Tool`.
  - MoM growth/seasonality tuned so dual-threshold breaches are rare on clean data.
  - Stale generated eval JSON cleared to `[]` / null score until hand-written `cases.yaml` exists.
  - Agent/MCP/UI defaults left untouched this slice (may still reference legacy entity ids until a later slice).
