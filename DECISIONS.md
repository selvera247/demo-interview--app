# Decisions

## 2026-10-03 — Use SQLite instead of DuckDB

- **Decision:** Keep SQLite as the demo datastore; do not add DuckDB.
- **Why:** The working scaffold already uses SQLite; migrating adds a dependency and rewrite cost without changing the hiring-manager demo narrative. SPEC amended accordingly (~40 accounts, SQLite).
- **Implications:** README, generator, MCP tools, and tests target SQLite. No `duckdb` in `requirements.txt`.
